# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a simple static portfolio webpage built using HTML and internal CSS.  
It contains information about the student including About, Skills, Projects and Contact details.  
The goal of this project is to learn basic web development and practice using Git and GitHub.



## 2. Development Process

### Step 1 – Planning
I decided the structure of the webpage and listed the sections:  
Header, About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact.

### Step 2 – Writing Code
I created an HTML file and wrote the content using tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<a>`.  
I used internal CSS inside `<style>` tag to format the design with colors, spacing and alignment.

### Step 3 – Testing
I opened the HTML file in the browser and checked the output.  
I made small changes in the layout until the page looked clean and readable.

### Step 4 – Using Git and GitHub
- I initialized the repository using `git init`
- I added files using `git add .`
- I committed the code using `git commit`
- I created a repository on GitHub
- I pushed the project using `git push`

## 3. Future Improvements
In future versions, I want to improve the webpage by:
- Adding a profile photo
- Adding education & achievements sections
- Making the webpage responsive for mobile users
- Adding animations using CSS or JavaScript
- Adding more project sections
